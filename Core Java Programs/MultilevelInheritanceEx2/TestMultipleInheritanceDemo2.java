/*
 * java does not support multiple inheritance
 *  because of ambiguity
 * 
 * According to given example ,
 * class A and class B inherited by C
 * here once we create the object of C , we must have to
 *  invoke
 * constructor of immediate child class 
 * but compiler confuse to call super class constructors
 *  because C 
 * is inherited by more than one class
 * 
 * to resolve these problem in java they introduced the 
 * concept of 
 * interface
 * so instead of multiple inheritance we can use interface
 *
